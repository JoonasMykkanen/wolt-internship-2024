# Wolt Summer 2024 Engineering Internships - Joonas MykkÃ¤nen

### How to run
```Download repo or zip```
```pip3 -r requirements.txt```
```python3 run.py```

My submission for BACKEND roles with Python and FastAPI.

Originally was going to implement with Flask but since Pydantic models offered nice validation and they are build with
FastAPI, decided to learn more of that. Have no prior experience with FastAPI except for Wolt's workshop @ Hive with it
that was kindly hosted by you.

### Program
App has been divided into modules and these can be modified independetly from each other. You can add or remove them
without breaking the App. Since subject only has one module, it seems a bit overkill.
* run.py - starts the program
* /tests - individual tests, can be ran with ```pytest -s tests/__FILE__```
* /app - Where everything ties together
* /routes - set up routers to handle paths like '/api' or '/'
* /services - Logic for routers to use, also could include databases, external api's etc







### Specification
Rules for calculating a delivery fee
* If the cart value is less than 10â‚¬, a small order surcharge is added to the delivery price. The surcharge is the difference between the cart value and 10â‚¬. For example if the cart value is 8.90â‚¬, the surcharge will be 1.10â‚¬.
* A delivery fee for the first 1000 meters (=1km) is 2â‚¬. If the delivery distance is longer than that, 1â‚¬ is added for every additional 500 meters that the courier needs to travel before reaching the destination. Even if the distance would be shorter than 500 meters, the minimum fee is always 1â‚¬.
  * Example 1: If the delivery distance is 1499 meters, the delivery fee is: 2â‚¬ base fee + 1â‚¬ for the additional 500 m => 3â‚¬
  * Example 2: If the delivery distance is 1500 meters, the delivery fee is: 2â‚¬ base fee + 1â‚¬ for the additional 500 m => 3â‚¬
  * Example 3: If the delivery distance is 1501 meters, the delivery fee is: 2â‚¬ base fee + 1â‚¬ for the first 500 m + 1â‚¬ for the second 500 m => 4â‚¬
* If the number of items is five or more, an additional 50 cent surcharge is added for each item above and including the fifth item. An extra "bulk" fee applies for more than 12 items of 1,20â‚¬
  * Example 1: If the number of items is 4, no extra surcharge
  * Example 2: If the number of items is 5, 50 cents surcharge is added
  * Example 3: If the number of items is 10, 3â‚¬ surcharge (6 x 50 cents) is added
  * Example 4: If the number of items is 13, 5,70â‚¬ surcharge is added ((9 * 50 cents) + 1,20â‚¬)
* The delivery fee can __never__ be more than 15â‚¬, including possible surcharges.
* The delivery is free (0â‚¬) when the cart value is equal or more than 200â‚¬. 
* During the Friday rush, 3 - 7 PM, the delivery fee (the total fee including possible surcharges) will be multiplied by 1.2x. However, the fee still cannot be more than the max (15â‚¬). Considering timezone, for simplicity, **use UTC as a timezone in backend solutions** (so Friday rush is 3 - 7 PM UTC). **In frontend solutions, use the timezone of the browser** (so Friday rush is 3 - 7 PM in the timezone of the browser).

### Expectations
When reviewing your code, we will focus on the part that fulfils the requirements explained above. We would love to see a well-tested and readable solution.

Pro tip: When you think you are ready with the assignment, take at least a few hours break, and then go through the code one more time before returning it.

### Submitting the assignment
Bundle everything into a Zip archive and upload it to Google Drive, Dropbox or similar and include the link in the application. Remember to check permissions! If we cannot access the file, we cannot review your code. Please donâ€™t store your solution in a public GitHub repository during the application period.

A good check before sending your task is to unzip the Zip archive into a new folder and check that building and running the project works, using the steps you define in readme.md. Forgotten dependencies and instructions can sometimes happen even to the best of us.

## Backend specifics

### Your task
Your task is to build an HTTP API which could be used for calculating the delivery fee.

Please use one of the programming languages available in the location you're applying to (Helsinki: Python / Kotlin & Berlin: Python / Kotlin / Scala). Feel free to use libraries / frameworks.

**Note that your technology choice here defines the scope of the possible technical interview and your focus area if starting to work at Wolt ðŸ˜Š**


### Specification
Implement an HTTP API (single POST endpoint) which calculates the delivery fee based on the information in the request payload (JSON) and includes the calculated delivery fee in the response payload (JSON).

#### Request
Example: 
```json
{"cart_value": 790, "delivery_distance": 2235, "number_of_items": 4, "time": "2024-01-15T13:00:00Z"}
```

## Frontend specifics

### Your task

Build a delivery fee calculator web app using **React and TypeScript**.

### Specification

Build a delivery fee calculator app which calculates a delivery fee based on user input and shows the calculated delivery fee to the user.

#### Input fields

| Field             | Type      | Description                                                                                             | Example value                             |
|:---               |:---       |:---                                                                                                     |:---                                       |
|Cart value         |Float      |Value of the shopping cart in euros.                                                                     |__20__                                     |

|Number of items    |Integer    |The __number of items__ in the customer's shopping cart.                                                 |__4__ (customer has 4 items in the cart)   |
|Order time         |Date + Time|The date/time when the order is being made (see rules-section how rush hours affect the delivery price)  |You can choose the most suitable format    |

#### Inputs and test ids

When creating web interfaces, it's important to ensure accessibility and ease of testing. For each `Field` in the table above, ensure that the root element containing the value, typically an input element, includes a `data-test-id` attribute. This attribute is used for identifying elements during automated testing. The value of data-test-id should be the camelCase version of the `Field` listed in the table. For example, the field `Cart value` in the table should correspond to `data-test-id="cartValue"`. For elements like custom datepickers that involve selecting a date via buttons, make sure there is also an input field, to ensure accessibility. The element containing the resulting fee that is calculated should also have a test id of `data-test-id=fee`.


#### Output example

Feel free to design and implement the user interface how you want. Below is an example of what it could look like.

When reviewing the assignment, we are focusing on the code quality and structure of your app. However, good UX & design will definitely give you bonus points. We also encourage you to consider accessibility in your implementation as that topic is close to our hearts here at Wolt. Crafting an accessible design and writing accessible code are the kind of good development practices we value.
